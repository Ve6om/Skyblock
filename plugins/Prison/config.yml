# Enables Prison's debug mode as soon as prison starts.
# Do not enable unless instructed to do so, since it will increase the amount of
# information sent to the console.  To turn on/off debug mode, the following

#  /prison debug

# Provides unidentifiable metrics so we can better understand what versions
# of minecraft, spigot, server OS, and the Prison plugin version that is 
# being used. This is used to understand what versions of spigot should be
# supported, and which versions of prison is actually being used and can
# greatly impact future development efforts. Enabling the 
# send-metrics would be greatly appreciatd since it will help us greatly.
# You can view the stats here: https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Prison

# NEW: Startup testing of available blocks within prison. Tests three kinds of
# sources: Prison's BlockType, XMaterial's blocks (should mirror what's avaiable
# within spigot/bukkit, and the raw spigot/bukkit source.
# This should only be used to see what's available for the current version of 
# spigot that is running on the server. This will not provide any 
# extra blocks for any prison environment.

# NEW: Placeholder progress bar.  
# Can control how many segments are generated.  The more segments that
# are displayed the better reactive it will appear to the players.
# Also what is used for the postive and negative parts of the status bar,
# including color code and the text character to use. The color code will
# only apply once, not for each segment.
# You must quote the colors and segments or the yaml file can be fail to load.

# Hesitancy Delay Penalty - The purpose of the Hesitancy Delay Penalty is to encourage players
# to rankup to the next rank.  Once a player exceeds the rankup cost, they start to incurr a 
# rankup penalty.  The penalty would be based upon the amount over the rankup cost.  So if a player
# has 1.1 million, then only 0.1 million will be subject to the penalty and the penalty will be 20%.
# The max value a player can achieve for a rank will be the rankup cost, then the Hesitancy 
# Delay Penalty will be subtracted from that amount. 
# For example, if the rankup cost would be 1.0 million and a player has 1.1 million, then their 
# max "score" they can achieve is 1.0 million, but the 20% penalty on the 0.1 million will be 
# subtracted from the "score".  So their adjusted score would be:
#   1.0 million - 0.1 million * 0.2 = 1.0 m - 20,000 = 0.8 m

# NEW: 
# Prison mines reset gap is the number of milliseconds that are used to 
# space out the mine resets when starting the server.  This value should 
# not be changed unless you understand what you are doing. This value
# is converted to ticks, so should use 50 millisecond increments. If too 
# small of a value is used then it could produce a large amount of lag 
# if more than one mine tries to reset at the same time, or close to each
# other.  This may be changed to ticks in the near future.

# Warning: Do not use the following option. This could break the natural Bukkit 
# loading behavior of Prison and other plugins.  It can have unexpected 
# side effects. 
# Use this feature ONLY when instructed by Prison support team and when 
# other solutions have be tried first.
#
#   CMI Economy, through Vault, can have an issue of not initializing itself until 
# all other plugins are done starting up, which means it's not active when prison 
# tries to start.  Prison must enable it's integration with Vault before
# it can enable Ranks, and everything that is depending upon ranks.  Failure to
# have a funcional Economy when Ranks are enabled could lead to runtime errors
# and even data corruption within your server, so ranks are disabled under those
# conditons.
#
#   To get CMI's economy working with Prison, this option wil test to see if the Vault 
# Economy is active, if it is, then it will allow Prison to start normally.  If not,
# it will allow the prison's onEnable() function to return with a "success" to tell
# Bukkit/Spigot that Prison was enabled successfully, but in reality, the 
# enabling of Prison will be delayed for 5 seconds and then it will try again.
# If it is, then Prison will be enabled.  If the Vault Economy is still not
# active, then it will try again in 5 seconds.  It will attempt to start 6
# times and if it fails to find an active Vault Economy then Prison will 
# NOT start up at all.
#
#   It's an all or nothing situation when you enable this feature.
#
# It's been reported that the correct value to use for CMI is: Economy_CMI
# Vault may report CMIEconomy but that is wrong.
#
# Warning: Other plugins that depend upon and use Prison may fail.  If they do fail 
# because of a delayed start, then that is beyond the scope of support that can
# be provided by Prison.  Delayed start is provided to get CMI working.  
# We cannot be responsible for their choices.   
#
# Note: The process that this controls ONLY checks for the activation of Vault
# Economy.  Therefore you must use CMI with Vault. Also this will "work" with 
# any other economy plugins using vault too.  But please do not use this 
# unless all other options have been exhusted. 
#
# To use the delayed startup:
# 1. delayedPrisonStartup.enabled: true
# 2. Optional: cooldown-secs and max-attemps identifies how frequently and how
#    many times Prison will try to hook in to the vault economy.
# 3. inspect-vault is optional. When enabled it will display what value must be
#    used with the vault-economy-name.
# 4. triggers.vault: true.  Must be true or this won't work. When true this
#    ensures Vault has been registered and is also enabled.
# 5. vault-economy-name: must match what's in vault.  If not, then prison will 
#    fail to start.
