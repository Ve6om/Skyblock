      &5 Foreword: Dear reader this book
      is intended to pass on my knowledge.
      Feeling the need to discover the
      arts of magic, I do not suggest
      to perform these experiments.
    1: |-
      Warnings:
      Do not stand too close to the cauldron
      as some magic is not stable, but they
      may produce the best outcome.
    2: |-
      I have encountered times where I've felt
      dumbfounded of the missing requirements
      to my experiment which caused my
      knowledge to decrease.
      PLEASE REMEMBER THE EXTRA INGREDIENTS.
    3: |-
      By using my magic stick on the cauldron
      and holding the key ingredient in my left
      hand... I manage to combine the ingredients
      in something new...
    4: |-
      Here are the combinations of elements
      that I manage to produce.
    last: |-
      In the Second Grimoire book you will
      find more recipes, but they require
      better magic stick, otherwise the
      outcome may explode.
